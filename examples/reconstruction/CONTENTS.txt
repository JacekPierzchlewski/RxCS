    # L1 reconstruction (reg. regression) with cvxopt examples:

    4. L1recon_ex0.py        - example #0 on L1 reg. regression [cvxopt] reconstruction - the simplest example of CS L1 reconstruction

    5. L1recon_ex1.py        - example #1 on L1 reg. regression [cvxopt] reconstruction - a more complicated example of CS L1
                               reconstruction with IDFT complex dictionary

    6. L1recon_ex2.py        - example #2 on L1 reg. regression [cvxopt] reconstruction - a more complicated example of CS L1
                               reconstruction with IDFT complex dictionary. Signal is generated by Random Multitone module.

    7. L1recon_ex3.py        - example #3 on L1 reg. regression [cvxopt] reconstruction - a more complicated example of CS L1
                               reconstruction with IDFT complex dictionary. Signal is generated by Random Multitone module.
                               Signal spectrum consists of two parts.


    # L1 reconstruction (basis pursuit) with IRLS examples:

    8. IRLSrecon_ex0.py      - example #0 on L1 basis pursuit reconstruction [IRLS]
