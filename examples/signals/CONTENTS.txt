    # Single run Random Multitone Signal Generator (RMSG) examples:

    4. RMSG_ex0.py        - example #0 on how to use RMSG generator - the simplest example with FFT analysis of the signal.

    5. RMSG_ex1.py        - example #1 on how to use RMSG generator - single signal generation, frequency is specified for
                            3 tones,  1 fully random tone. FFT analysis of the signal

    6. RMSG_ex2.py        - example #2 on how to use RMSG generator - single signal generation with 3 fully random tones.
                            FFT analysis of the signal

    7. RMSG_ex3.py        - example #3 on how to use RMSG generator - multiple signals generation with 11 tones with specfied
                            frequencies. Welch's analysis of the signals


    # Sparse vector generator examples:

    8. vect_sparse_ex0.py     - example #0 on how to use sparse vector generator - the simplest example, 5 sparse vectors are generated.
