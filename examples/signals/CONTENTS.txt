    # Single run Random Multitone Signal (RaMuS) Generator examples:

    4. sig_RMSG_ex0.py        - the simplest example. FFT analysis of the signal.

    5. sig_RMSG_ex1.py        - single RaMuS generation with specified frequencies
                                of 3 tones + 1 fully random tone. FFT analysis of the signal

    6. sig_RMSG_ex2.py        - single RaMuS generation with 3 fully random tones.
                                FFT analysis of the signal

    7. sig_RMSG_ex3.py        - multiple RaMuS generation with 11 tones with specfied frequencies.
                                Welch's analysis of the signals
