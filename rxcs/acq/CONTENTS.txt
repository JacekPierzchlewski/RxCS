    # Nonuniform samplers:

    4. nonuniANGIE.py         - nonuniform sampler with ANGIE sampling scheme

    5. @nonuniANGIE_test.py   - link to a module with tests for nonuniform sampler with ANGIE sampling scheme

    6. nonuniExtern.py        - nonuniform sampler with an external sampling scheme

    7. nonuniExternDummy.py   - dummy nonuniform sampler with an external sampling scheme
                                The sampler is 'dummy', because it does not sample the signal,
                                it only generates the observation matrix.

    8. nonuniARS.py           - nonuniform sampler with ARS sampling scheme

    9. nonuniJS.py            - nonuniform sampler with JS sampling scheme


    # Uniform samplers:

   10. uniform.py      - a uniform sampler


    # Additional modules:

   11. satur.py      - saturation block
