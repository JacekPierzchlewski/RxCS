    # Nonuniform samplers:

    4. nonuniANGIE.py        - a nonuniform sampler with ANGIE sampling scheme

    5. nonuniExtern.py       - a nonuniform sampler with an external sampling scheme

    6. nonuniExternDummy.py  - a dummy nonuniform sampler with an external sampling scheme
                               The sampler is 'dummy', because it does not sample the signal,
                               it only generates the observation matrix.

    7. nonuniARS.py          - a nonuniform sampler with ARS sampling scheme

    8. nonuniJS.py           - a nonuniform sampler with JS sampling scheme


    # Uniform samplers:

    9. uniform.py      - a uniform sampler
